# Greetings, stranger!

👋 Name's Artem, but you can call me Tom. I'm an aspiring front-end developer from Moscow, who can't keep his hands off the keyboard.

🏢 I am a pharmacist with ~8 years of experience in the process of broadening my career opportunities.

📚 I've been studying non-stop from various sources since June 2022, at the moment I'm taking on this <a href='https://www.udemy.com/course/react-and-typescript-build-a-portfolio-project/'>udemy course</a>.

💬 My english level is C1, I averaged 7.5 on the IELTS test in July 2022.

🎯 Despite having a lot of fun developing new projects, I'm ever on the look-out for entry-level positions with double the fun. So feel free to contact me)
